            <p>Welcome to "The Unseen Roots," a project exploring the inseparable link between the Palus people and the
                Palouse Prairie. When you look at the Palouse, you see rolling hills of wheat. My project is about what
                we <em>don't</em> see—the history and the people this agricultural landscape replaced.</p>
            <p class="contention">
                <u>I will contend that the historical removal and displacement of the Palus people directly contributed
                    to the extensive agricultural transformation of the landscape, and that modern efforts to restore
                    the native prairie must acknowledge and incorporate Indigenous knowledge and land management
                    practices to be truly effective.</u>

                <h2>A Displaced People</h2>
                <p>Before settlers, the Palouse was a carefully managed environment. The Palus lived in semi-permanent
                    villages, migrating in "seasonal rounds" to fish, hunt, and gather vital "first foods" like camas
                    bulbs. Camas, a lily-like plant with a nutritious bulb, was a staple. Harvesting it was an act of
                    stewardship; digging aerated the soil and smaller bulbs were replanted to ensure future harvests
                    (NPS). Hunting for elk and deer and fishing for salmon in the Snake and Palouse rivers were also
                    central to their way of life and ecological balance.</p>
                <p>Policies like the <a

                    broke up communal Tribal lands into small, individual plots (U.S. National Park Service; University
                    of Washington). "Surplus" land was opened to white homesteaders, replacing a shared ecosystem with a
                    grid of private property (U.S. National Park Service; University of Washington).</p>

                <h2>An Altered Land</h2>
                <p>Today, less than 1% of the original Palouse Prairie remains (Washington State University, "Hudson").
                    Organizations like the <strong>Palouse Conservation Environmental Institute (PCEI)</strong> are
                    doing critical work to restore small patches of this native landscape (Palouse Conservation
                    Environmental Institute).</p>
                <p>However, ecological restoration that ignores the region's human history is incomplete. To be truly
                    effective, these efforts must incorporate <strong>Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)</strong>.
                    While Indigenous Knowledge is a broad system encompassing culture, spirituality, and history, TEK is
                    the specific, practical application of that knowledge to the environment. It is an adaptive
                    understanding of the land acquired over thousands of years. For example, the Nez Perce tribe's use
                    of controlled burns and selective harvesting of camas (NPS) represents a sophisticated land
                    management system that modern restorationists are now beginning to adopt to improve biodiversity.

                        Washington).</p>

                        <li><strong>Know Your Soil:</strong> The Palouse has deep, loess soils. Restoration experts
                            apply this by preventing erosion through "no-till" farming, which mimics the natural soil
                            cover and keeps the structure intact (Huggins & Reganold).</li>
                        <li><strong>Plant Natives:</strong> Use native bunchgrasses like Idaho Fescue and Bluebunch
                            Wheatgrass. These deep-rooted plants stabilize the soil better than introduced crops.</li>
                        <li><strong>Respect the Cycle:</strong> Learn from TEK. Harvests should be sustainable. If
                            planting camas, ensure the soil is aerated and leave smaller bulbs to regenerate (NPS).</li>
                        <li><strong>Water Wisdom:</strong> Restore riparian buffers (streamside vegetation) to cool the
                            water for salmon and prevent runoff, a practice championed by groups like PCEI.</li>

            <h2>A Path Forward</h2>
            <p>The ecological state of the prairie and the human history of the Palus are not two separate issues; they
                are one. The landscape we see today was only possible <em>after</em> the removal of its original
                stewards. Therefore, we cannot restore one without the other. The goal is not just to return the
                <em>plants</em>, but to restore the <em>relationship</em>.
