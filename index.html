          <div class="details">
            <p>The accident began when the plant's main feedwater pumps stopped running, caused by either a mechanical or electrical failure, which prevented the steam generators from removing heat.</p>
            <p>First the turbine, then the reactor automatically shut down. Pressure in the primary system (the nuclear portion of the plant) began to increase. To prevent that pressure from becoming excessive, the PORV (pilot-operated relief valve) opened automatically. The PORV should have closed when the pressure decreased, but it became stuck open.</p>

          <div class="details">
            <p>The operators did not recognize that the plant was experiencing a loss-of-coolant accident. They believed the PORV had automatically closed, which would have been the normal response.</p>
            <p>Control room instruments did not show the valve's actual position, and coolant continued to escape through it. Because the PORV remained stuck open, coolant from the core was draining away.</p>
            <p>The Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) activated automatically but the operators, believing the core was sufficiently covered with water, manually overrode the system, making the situation worse.</p>

            <p>With insufficient cooling water, the nuclear fuel overheated. The zirconium cladding that encases the uranium fuel pellets reacted with the cooling water at high temperatures, producing hydrogen gas.</p>
            <p>By early morning, the core had been severely damaged. About half of the core melted during the accident, though this wasn't fully understood until years later after thorough investigations.</p>
            <p>The hydrogen created by this reaction formed a large bubble in the top of the pressure vessel, further complicating the situation.</p>

          <div class="details">
            <p>Experts worked to determine how to remove the hydrogen bubble without causing an explosion. Initially, there were fears that the hydrogen might detonate, but further analysis showed that there wasn't enough oxygen in the pressure vessel to support combustion.</p>
            <p>By March 30, cooling was largely restored, though concerns about the hydrogen bubble remained. Governor Thornburgh advised pregnant women and pre-school children within 5 miles of the plant to evacuate as a precautionary measure.</p>
            <p>President Jimmy Carter, a trained nuclear engineer, visited the plant on April 1 to demonstrate his confidence in the management of the crisis.</p>

          <div class="details">
            <p>By April 27, the hydrogen bubble was eliminated, and the reactor was brought to cold shutdown, ending the immediate crisis. The cleanup effort would take more than 12 years and cost approximately $973 million.</p>
            <p>The President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island (also known as the Kemeny Commission) was formed to investigate the accident. Their report led to sweeping changes in emergency response planning, reactor operator training, and other areas of nuclear power plant operations.</p>
            <p>The accident at Three Mile Island remains the most serious in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant history, though its health and environmental consequences were minimal.</p>
