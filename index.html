            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to "The Unseen Roots," a project exploring the inseparable link between the Palus people and the Palouse Prairie. When you look at the Palouse, you see rolling hills of wheat. My project is about what we *don't* see—the history and the people this agricultural landscape replaced.</p>
            <p class="contention">
                <u>I will contend that the historical removal and displacement of the Palus people directly contributed to the extensive agricultural transformation of the landscape, and that modern efforts to restore the native prairie must acknowledge and incorporate Indigenous knowledge and land management practices to be truly effective.</u>

                <h2>A Displaced People</h2>
                <p>Before settlers, the Palouse was a carefully managed environment. The Palus lived in semi-permanent villages, migrating in "seasonal rounds" to fish, hunt, and gather vital "first foods" like camas bulbs. This was active stewardship.</p>
                <p>Policies like the <strong>Homestead Act of 1862</strong> and the <strong>Dawes Act of 1887</strong> broke up communal Tribal lands into small, individual plots (U.S. National Park Service; University of Washington). "Surplus" land was opened to white homesteaders, replacing a shared ecosystem with a grid of private property (U.S. National Park Service; University of Washington).</p>

                <h2>An Altered Land</h2>
                <p>Today, less than 1% of the original Palouse Prairie remains (Washington State University, "Hudson"). Organizations like the <strong>Palouse Conservation Environmental Institute (PCEI)</strong> are doing critical work to restore small patches of this native landscape (Palouse Conservation Environmental Institute).</p>
                <p>However, this is where my contention comes in. Ecological restoration that ignores the region's human history is incomplete. To be truly effective, these efforts must incorporate <strong>Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)</strong>.</p>

            <h2>A Path Forward</h2>
            <p>The ecological state of the prairie and the human history of the Palus are not two separate issues; they are one. The landscape we see today was only possible <em>after</em> the removal of its original stewards. Therefore, we cannot restore one without the other. The goal is not just to return the *plants*, but to restore the *relationship*.</p>
