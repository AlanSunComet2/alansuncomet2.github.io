            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to "The Unseen Roots," a project exploring the inseparable link between the Palus people and the Palouse Prairie...</p>
            <p class="contention">
                <u>I will contend that the historical removal and displacement of the Palus people directly contributed to the extensive agricultural transformation of the landscape, and that modern efforts to restore the native prairie must acknowledge and incorporate Indigenous knowledge and land management practices to be truly effective.</u>

            <h2>A Displaced People: The Palus (Palouse)</h2>
            <p>Before the arrival of settlers, the Palouse was not an empty wilderness; it was a carefully managed environment...</p>

            <p>This changed with the treaties of the 1850s... The <i>Dawes Act of 1887</i> was the final blow...</p>

            <h2>An Altered Land: Restoring the Prairie</h2>
            <p>Today, less than 1% of the original Palouse Prairie remains... Organizations like the <strong>Palouse Conservation Environmental Institute (PCEI)</strong> are doing critical work...</p>

            <p>However, this is where my contention comes in. Ecological restoration that ignores the region's human history is incomplete...</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Beyond Planting:</strong> It means reintroducing Indigenous land management practices...</li>
                <li><strong>A Holistic View:</strong> It means adopting a different worldview, as Indigenous scholars like JoAnn Archibald explain...</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Restoration:</strong> Effective restoration is also cultural...</li>
